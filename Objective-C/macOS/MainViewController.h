Abstract:
Manages the child view controllers: AvailableProducts, InvalidProductIdentifiers, PurchasesDetails, and MessagesViewController. Requests product
 information about a list of product identifiers using StoreManager. Calls StoreObserver to implement the restoration of purchases. Displays a pop-up

 transactions.
